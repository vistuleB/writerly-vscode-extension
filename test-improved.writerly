# Improved File Path Detection Test

This file tests the improved path detection functionality.

## Basic File Paths

Place cursor anywhere in these paths and press Cmd+Shift+O:

### Relative paths
../package.json
../logo.png
../README.md
./examples/demo.writerly
../src/extension.ts

### Quoted paths (should work better now)
"../tsconfig.json"
'../logo.svg'
`../LICENSE`

## Mixed Content (cursor detection improved)

Check the main configuration at ../package.json for details.
The logo image is located at "../logo.png" and you can also find the SVG version at '../logo.svg'.
Documentation is available in `../README.md` file.

## Complex Scenarios

### Paths in sentences
You can find the source code in ../src/fileOpener.ts which handles the opening logic.
The hover functionality is implemented in "../src/hoverProvider.ts" file.

### Multiple paths in one line
Config: ../package.json, License: ../LICENSE, Logo: ../logo.png

### Paths with different quote styles
Primary: "../package.json", Secondary: '../tsconfig.json', Tertiary: `../README.md`

## What's Improved

1. **Better cursor detection**: Uses position-based approach like vscode-open-url
2. **Smarter path extraction**: Handles quoted and unquoted paths better
3. **Reliable opening**: Uses vscode.env.openExternal first, then fallback to spawn
4. **VSCode fallback**: If system opening fails, opens in VSCode instead

## Test Instructions

1. Place cursor ANYWHERE within a file path (beginning, middle, end)
2. Press Cmd+Shift+O (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+O (Windows/Linux)
3. Or use Command Palette: "Open File Under Cursor"
4. Hover over paths to see file information (this feature is preserved!)

## Expected Results

- ✅ Paths should be detected even with cursor at any position
- ✅ Quoted paths should work correctly
- ✅ Files open with system default app or VSCode fallback
- ✅ Hover previews still work for file information
- ✅ Better error messages and handling

Try moving your cursor to different positions within the same path to test the improved detection!
