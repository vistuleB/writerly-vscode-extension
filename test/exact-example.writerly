|> Tag
    attr1=  val1
    attr2= val2
    attr3=
    attr4=val4
    attr5 =val5
    attr6=val6

In the above example:
- attr1, attr2, attr3, attr4 should be valid attributes (highlighted properly)
- attr5 and attr6 should appear as ordinary text (not highlighted as attributes)
- The space before = in attr5 breaks attribute parsing
- Everything after attr5 becomes plain text until the next tag

|> AnotherTag
    working=fine
    also= working with space after
    broken =space before equals
    notattribute=plain text now

The "broken =space before equals" line should break parsing,
so "notattribute=plain text now" appears as regular text.

|> EmptyKeyTest
    valid=attribute
    =invalid-empty-key
    subsequent=should-be-text

The line starting with "=" (empty key) should break parsing.

|> RecoveryTest
    success=true
    normal= attribute with space after equals

New tags should recover and parse attributes normally again.
