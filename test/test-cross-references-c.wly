    title=Cross Reference Test Document C
    handle=doc-c-main
    author=test-suite
    version=3.0

This is document C, the final piece in the cross-reference testing triangle.

|> introduction
    handle=doc-c-intro
    references=doc-a,doc-b

Introduction to document C. This connects to >>doc-a and >>doc-b-main from the other test files.

|> shared-components
    handle=shared-component
    type=reusable
    used-by=all-docs

Shared components that are referenced by both >>doc-a and >>doc-b-main. The >>shared-component is available across all documents.

|> linking-test
    handle=link-validator-c
    validates=cross-references

Testing cross-document linking functionality with references to:
- >>doc-a-intro (from document A)
- >>doc-b-overview (from document B)
- >>user-data (from document A)
- >>shared-utils (from document B)

|> middleware
    handle=middleware-c
    layer=business-logic

Middleware that processes data from >>core-algorithm and >>data-processor.

|> aggregation
    handle=data-aggregator
    sources=multiple

Data aggregation service that combines:
- >>user-data from document A
- >>shared-utils from document B
- >>middleware-c processing layer

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE active = true;
-- This >>fake-reference in code should not be detected
```

Post-codeblock references work: >>doc-c-main and >>data-aggregator.

|> integration-layer
    handle=integration-c
    connects=all-systems

Integration layer connecting >>doc-a, >>doc-b-main, and >>doc-c-intro for seamless operation.

|> api-gateway
    handle=gateway-c
    proxies=user-api

API Gateway that routes requests to >>user-api and >>data-processor endpoints.

|> monitoring
    handle=monitor-c
    tracks=performance

Monitoring system for >>core-algorithm performance and >>perf-metrics-b data collection.

Text with complex cross-references: The >>gateway-c routes to >>user-api, processes via >>core-algorithm, validates with >>validator-b, and monitors using >>monitor-c.

|> security-layer
    handle=security-c
    protects=all-endpoints

Security layer protecting >>user-api, >>gateway-c, and >>data-aggregator from unauthorized access.

|> configuration-manager
    handle=config-manager-c
    manages=settings

Configuration manager that works with >>config-settings from document A and >>shared-component utilities.

|> event-system
    handle=event-hub-c
    distributes=notifications

Event distribution hub that notifies about >>user-data changes, >>core-algorithm results, and >>integration-c status updates.

Testing bidirectional references: >>bidirectional-demo from document B should link back here, while we reference >>components-b and >>error-handler-b.

|> cache-layer
    handle=cache-c
    stores=processed-data

Caching layer for >>data-aggregator results and >>core-algorithm computations.

|> workflow-engine
    handle=workflow-c
    orchestrates=processes

Workflow engine that orchestrates:
1. >>user-data retrieval
2. >>core-algorithm processing
3. >>data-aggregator compilation
4. >>cache-c storage
5. >>event-hub-c notifications

|> reporting
    handle=reports-c
    generates=analytics

Reporting system using data from >>perf-metrics-b, >>monitor-c, and >>workflow-c for comprehensive analytics.

|> footer
    handle=doc-c-footer
    status=complete

Document C footer. This >>doc-c-footer is referenced by document A to test cross-file linking.

Final comprehensive test paragraph:
The complete system spans >>doc-a (core definitions), >>doc-b-main (integration logic), and >>doc-c-main (orchestration layer). Key components include >>shared-component (utilities), >>user-data (storage), >>core-algorithm (processing), >>gateway-c (routing), >>security-c (protection), >>workflow-c (orchestration), and >>reports-c (analytics). The >>event-hub-c distributes notifications while >>cache-c optimizes performance and >>monitor-c tracks metrics across all >>integration-c connections.
