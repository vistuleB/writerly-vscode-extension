|> section
    title=MySection
    id=main-content
    class=highlight

This should work fine - all attributes are properly formatted.

|> subsection
    name=subsec1
    visible=true
    count=42

More content here.

|> problematic
    attr1=good
    attr2= badspace
    attr3=alsogood
    attr4=shouldnotparse

The line with "attr2= badspace" has a space after equals, so everything from that line onwards (including attr3, attr4, and text) should be treated as ordinary text, not attributes.

|> another
    before=ok
    during=fail
    after=ignored

Same here - "during =fail" has space before equals, so "after=ignored" should be plain text.

|> valid
    key=value
    name=test
    enabled=true

This block should work normally again.

|> edge-cases
    noequals
    empty=
    spaces in value=this should work
    key_with_underscores=ok
    key-with-hyphens=ok

Testing various edge cases.
