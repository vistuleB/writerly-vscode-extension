    title=Testing WLY Extension
    type=language-test
    version=1.0
    handle=yoyo-23_
    >>yoyo-23_

This file tests the Writerly extension with the correct .wly file extension.
The language ID should now be "wly" instead of "writerly".

|> semantic-tokens
    feature=highlighting
    status=active

Testing semantic token highlighting:
- |> pipe symbols should be highlighted as keywords
- Tag names should be highlighted as types
- Attribute keys should be highlighted as properties
- Values should be highlighted as strings

|> attributes-test
    simple=value
    with_underscore=test_value
    with-hyphen=test-value
    with.dot=dot.notation
    namespace:key=namespaced-value
    xml:lang=en
    data.bind:model=complex-case
    empty=
    spaces= value with spaces after equals

Testing various attribute patterns with the wly language ID.

|> comments-test
    active=true
    !!disabled=commented-attribute
    working=normal

! This is a regular comment
! Testing comment highlighting with wly extension

|> code-blocks-test
    language=mixed
    nesting=supported

Testing code block handling:

```
This is a code block that should be highlighted as markup.
Content inside should maintain consistent coloring.

    ```python
    # This inner block should be treated as content
    print("Hello from nested code!")
    ```

More content in the outer block.
```

The code block above should respect same-indentation closing rules.

|> validation-test
    good=attribute
    bad =space-before-equals
    ignored=should-be-plain-text

The "bad =space-before-equals" should trigger validation errors,
and "ignored=should-be-plain-text" should appear as plain text.

|> tag-validation
    test=valid-tags

Valid tag examples:
- Simple tags work
- Complex tags with hyphens, dots, colons work
- Invalid tags should show immediate error feedback

|> invalid-tag-test

This should work fine.

|> invalid-start
    handle=l2
    error=Should show validation error

    Hello world.

The tag above should trigger validation error for starting with number. >>l2

Expected behavior with wly extension:
1. Language ID recognized as "wly"
2. Semantic highlighting active
3. Validation errors shown immediately
4. Code blocks handle nesting correctly
5. All Writerly language features work with .wly files

Testing successful if all features work with the wly language identifier!
