    title=Cross Reference Test Document A
    handle=doc-a
    version=1.0

This is document A. It defines several handles that will be referenced from other files.

|> introduction
    handle=doc-a-intro
    type=overview

This introduction explains the cross-referencing system. See >>doc-a for the main document info.

|> data-section
    handle=user-data
    format=json
    source=external

Important user data is stored here. This >>user-data can be referenced from other documents.

|> algorithm
    handle=core-algorithm
    complexity=O(n)

The core algorithm implementation:

```python
def core_process(data):
    return process(data)
```

The >>core-algorithm is used throughout the system.

|> configuration
    handle=config-settings
    env=production

Configuration settings for the application. These >>config-settings are critical.

Regular text that references handles from this document: >>doc-a-intro and >>user-data.

|> cross-file-usage
    handle=cross-ref-demo

This section will be referenced from other test files. The >>cross-ref-demo shows how cross-file references work.

References to handles that should exist in other files:
- >>doc-b-main (from test-cross-references-b.wly)
- >>shared-component (from test-shared-components.wly)
- >>doc-c-footer (from test-cross-references-c.wly)

|> api-endpoint
    handle=user-api
    path=/api/users
    method=GET

The >>user-api endpoint provides access to >>user-data.

Text with mixed local and cross-file references: >>doc-a combined with >>doc-b-main creates the full system.

|> conclusion
    handle=doc-a-conclusion

Summary of document A. References: >>core-algorithm, >>config-settings, and >>user-api are the main components.

Cross-references to verify: >>shared-component and >>doc-c-footer should link to other files.
