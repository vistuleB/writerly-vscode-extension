    This is a test file to verify code block syntax highlighting.

    Here's a code block at root level (no indentation):

    ```python-prompt
    >>> (6 + 8) * 3
    42
    >>> (24 / 4 / 2) * (24 / ( 4 / 2)) + 1
    37
    >>> 3 + 7 * 8
    59
    >>> (2 * 3))
    File "<stdin>", line 1
        (2 * 3))
            ^
    SyntaxError: unmatched ')'
    >>> (* 3)
    File "<stdin>", line 1
        (* 3)
        ^^^
    SyntaxError: cannot use starred expression here
    ```

    And here's an indented code block:

    ```javascript
    function test() {
        console.log("Hello World");
        return 42;
    }
    ```

    |> subsection
        And here's a deeply indented code block:

        ```python
        def factorial(n):
            if n <= 1:
                return 1
            return n * factorial(n - 1)

        print(factorial(5))
        ```
