    description=Testing three specific fixes for the wly extension
    version=1.0

This file tests the three bug fixes:
1. Missing warning/error diagnostics (red underlines)
2. Tag highlighting - last character different color
3. Nested code block highlighting

|> diagnostics-test
    title=Testing Error Diagnostics
    status=active

Testing validation errors that should show red underlines:

|> valid-tag
    good=attribute
    also= space-after-equals-ok

|> invalid-tag-test

Empty tag above should show red underline error immediately.

|> space-before-equals-test
    valid=attribute
    invalid =space-before-equals
    should=be-plain-text

The "invalid =space-before-equals" should show red underline and make subsequent lines plain text.

|> 123invalid-number-start
    error=This tag starts with number and should show red underline

|> @invalid-special-character
    error=This tag starts with @ symbol and should show red underline

|> tag-highlighting-test
    description=Testing that entire tag name has same color
    issue=Last character different color

Tags to test uniform highlighting:
- Simple tags: section, test, example
- Complex tags: my-complex.tag:namespace-test
- Tags with dots: data.binding.test
- Tags with colons: xml:namespace:test
- Tags with hyphens: kebab-case-tag-name

The ENTIRE tag name should have consistent type coloring, no character should be different.

|> my-very-long-tag-name-to-test-consistent-highlighting
    test=The entire tag name above should be same color

|> complex.nested:namespace-test.example
    test=This complex tag should be uniformly colored

|> nested-code-block-test
    language=html-javascript
    nesting=deep

Testing nested code blocks - the ENTIRE content should be green (markup color):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Nested Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    ```javascript
    function greet(name) {
        return `Hello, ${name}!`;
    }

    console.log(greet("World"));
    ```
    <p>More HTML content</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Expected behavior for nested code block above:
- Opening ```html should be green (markup)
- ALL HTML content should be green (markup)
- The inner ```javascript line should be green (markup) - NOT treated as boundary
- ALL JavaScript content should be green (markup)
- The inner ``` closing should be green (markup) - NOT treated as boundary
- Remaining HTML should be green (markup)
- Final closing ``` should be green (markup)

|> another-nested-test
    type=markdown-with-code

```markdown
# Documentation

This is markdown content.

    ```python
    def hello():
        print("This should all be green markup")
        return "nested content"
    ```

More markdown content here.

    ```bash
    echo "This bash code should also be green"
    ls -la
    ```

End of markdown.
```

All content above should be uniformly green - no inner boundaries should break highlighting.

|> validation-edge-cases
    working=fine

Missing closure test:

```
This code block has no closing backticks.
It should show error on next tag line.
```

|> this-tag-should-show-missing-closure-error
    error=Should show red underline about missing closure above

|> recovery-test
    success=Extension should recover after errors

Expected results:
1. RED UNDERLINES appear on invalid syntax (tags, attributes, missing closures)
2. TAG NAMES have consistent coloring - no character differences
3. NESTED CODE BLOCKS are entirely green - inner backticks don't break highlighting
4. ERRORS appear immediately, not just at end of file

```
    <h1>HTML content</h1>
    ```
    print("nested code")
    ```
```
