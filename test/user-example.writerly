    description=Testing the exact example provided by the user

This file tests the specific case mentioned where Python code inside
a larger code block should be treated as content, not as a delimiter.

|> user-example
    type=nested-html-python

The user's exact example:

```
<h1>Hello world</h1>
    ```python
    println("hello")
    ```
```

Expected behavior:
- The outer ``` opens a code block at indentation level 0
- The inner ```python at indentation level 4 should be treated as CONTENT
- The inner ``` at indentation level 4 should be treated as CONTENT
- Only the final ``` at indentation level 0 should close the code block

This should be highlighted as ONE code block containing HTML and Python text,
not as separate blocks that cause parsing errors.

|> verification
    status=testing-fix

If the fix works correctly:
- No validation errors should appear
- The entire content between the first and last ``` should be green (code block color)
- The middle ```python and ``` should not be treated as delimiters

Before the fix:
- ```python would incorrectly close the outer block
- println("hello") would appear as regular text
- The final ``` would start a new unclosed block causing errors

After the fix:
- All content should be properly contained in one code block
- Same indentation rule: only ``` at same level as opener can close
