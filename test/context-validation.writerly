    title=Valid attributes in context
    class=highlight

This is normal paragraph text. The following line has equals signs but should NOT trigger attribute validation errors:

$\gamma = w \in \Sigma^*$ und somit

Another mathematical expression: $x = y + z$ where variables are defined.

Some text with equals in it: The equation E = mc² is famous.

Regular text: if condition = true then execute.

|> another-section
    valid=attribute
    working=fine

Back to normal text. More equations:

The formula $a = b + c$ should not cause validation errors.

Also: result = function(input) is programming syntax, not an attribute.

|> code-example
    language=mathematics

Mathematical content:
- $\alpha = \beta + \gamma$
- $\delta = \epsilon \times \zeta$
- Integration: $\int f(x)dx = F(x) + C$

Programming content:
- variable = value
- result = calculate(input)
- config = load_settings()

None of the above should trigger attribute validation warnings.

|> indented-but-not-attributes
    valid=attribute

    This indented text has equations: $y = mx + b$ and should be fine.

    More indented content: result = process(data) but not attributes.

Back to root level text with equations: $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$ is a quadratic function.

|> final-test
    success=true
    validated=context-aware

Mathematical expressions at root level:
- $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = total$
- $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1$
- Simple equality: a = b

All above should be treated as regular text, not attributes.
