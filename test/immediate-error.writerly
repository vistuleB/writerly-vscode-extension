    description=Simple test for missing closure detection

Testing immediate error feedback instead of end-of-file errors.

|> test-case
    type=missing-closure

Code block without proper closure:

```
This code block is never closed.
Content goes here.
Some more content.
```

|> next-tag
    error=This tag should immediately show missing closure error

The error should appear on the line above (the tag line) immediately,
not at the end of the document.

Expected behavior:
- Error on "|> next-tag" line: "Missing code block closure..."
- Error on the opening "```" line: "Code block opened here is never closed"
- Immediate feedback, not delayed until end of file
