# Test File for Fixed Open File Under Cursor

This file tests that the "Cannot read properties of undefined" error is fixed.

## Simple Test Cases

Place your cursor anywhere in these paths and press Cmd+Shift+O:

### Basic files that should exist:
../package.json
../README.md
../LICENSE

### Quoted paths:
"../logo.png"
'../tsconfig.json'
`../src/extension.ts`

## Test Instructions

1. Place cursor anywhere within a file path above
2. Press Cmd+Shift+O (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+O (Windows/Linux)
3. The file should open without any "undefined" errors

If you still get the error, check:
- VSCode Developer Console (Help → Toggle Developer Tools)
- Make sure you're in a .writerly file
- Ensure the extension is activated

## Expected Behavior

✅ No "Cannot read properties of undefined" error
✅ Files open with system default application
✅ Error messages are clear and helpful
✅ Hover still works for file information
